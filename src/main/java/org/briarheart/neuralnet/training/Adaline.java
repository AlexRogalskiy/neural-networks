 * As Wikipedia states:
 * <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADALINE">
 *     ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron or later Adaptive Linear Element) is an early single-layer artificial neural
 *     network and the name of the physical device that implemented this network. The network uses memistors.
 *     <sup>1</sup>. It was developed by Professor Bernard Widrow and his graduate student Ted Hoff at Stanford
 *     University in 1960. It is based on the McCullochâ€“Pitts neuron. It consists of a weight, a bias and a summation
 *     function.
